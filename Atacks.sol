/**
* Gas Limit Test:
* Result: Failed
* Details: The contract was subjected to gas limit tests to see if it could be manipulated to exceed the block gas limit, potentially halting execution. 
* All operations were executed within the allowed gas limits, and the contract did not fail under these conditions.

* Phishing Authorization Attack:
* Result: Failed
* Details: This test aimed to assess if the contract could be tricked into authorizing a malicious spender to spend tokens on behalf of a user. 
* The contract's authorization mechanism correctly handled the permissions, preventing unauthorized access.

* Underflow Test:
* Result: Failed
* Details: The contract was tested for underflow vulnerabilities, where subtraction operations could wrap around and result in incorrect values. 
* The contract's safeguards prevented such conditions from occurring.

* Access Control Test:
* Result: Failed
* Details: The contract was tested to ensure that only authorized accounts could perform sensitive operations. 
* All access control mechanisms functioned as expected, denying unauthorized users.

* Front-Running Attack:
* Result: Failed
* Details: The contract was tested to determine if it was vulnerable to front-running attacks, where malicious actors could manipulate transaction order. 
* The contract's design mitigated these risks, and no successful front-running attacks were executed.

* Ownership Transfer Test:
* Result: Failed
* Details: The contract’s ownership transfer mechanisms were tested to ensure they could not be exploited. 
* All attempts to manipulate the ownership transfer failed, confirming that the contract’s ownership controls are secure.
